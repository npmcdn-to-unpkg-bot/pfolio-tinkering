Bonus functionality using Javascript and jQuery:

    “I should be able to reveal your navigation by clicking on a button, and also be able to hide your navigation by pushing that button again or by pressing an ‘X’ button,” (like this page).

    “If your portfolio is one page, I want your navigation links to take me there by scrolling down the page smoothly, instead of the page suddenly clicking down to an anchor tag,” (like this page when you click “Read more”).

    “I want to see more about your project by clicking on its image, but without leaving the current page. A modal window should appear on top of your page with details about the project I clicked on,” (like this page when you click on “Show”).
