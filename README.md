Basic functionality using Javascript and jQuery:    

    “I want to see your projects organized like cards, that rearrange as I resize my browser window.”
        “I also want to be able to filter through your portfolio projects using buttons that say things like, ‘HTML & CSS’, ‘Javascript & jQuery’ etc., that make only corresponding projects visible,” (like this page).

    “If your portfolio is one page, I want your navigation links to take me there by scrolling down the page smoothly, instead of the page suddenly clicking down to an anchor tag,” (like this page when you click “Read more”).

    “I want to see more about your project by clicking on its image, but without leaving the current page. A modal window should appear on top of your page with details about the project I clicked on,” (like this page when you click on “Show”).
